once we've pulled this repo, 
ideally with two or three commits in it,
we'll make a bunch of changes in another repo and bring it in as a remote
that way it can't be rebased onto main, recreating the merge conflict

before we rename the branches, the repo should be forked and pulled
then we rename the branches and see what happens
